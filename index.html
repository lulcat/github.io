does this static web page like the good ol' 90s support any scripting lingos??

- ok, so for someone who , like me, has never bothered with using these
fancy site pages etc.

1. I created repo with username.github.io

2. add ssh key. e.g your favourite ed25519 key ,)

3. check it works with ssh -T you@github.com I think it was :D 

until successful:

4.. I cloned it with https, so I will add this here, if so one has to change with

git remote rm origin
git remote add origin git@github.com:user/user.github.io

and if not, it probably already works, by trying with

 git push -u origin main
